# Simple Task Management System with React

This is part of the Full Stack Exam submission of John Edrick M. Gador.

The project runs on the assumption that a database named "baytech" with a table named "Tasks" is present in the tester's local MySQL server.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** ReactJS

**Server:** NodeJS, ExpressJS

**Database:** MySQL


## Run Locally

If all the assumptions are met, open the project in your code editor. Open a terminal in the project's directory and run:

```bash
  npm install
```

This will install all the packages needed by the project. After that, we can now run the project by executing the following inside the terminal:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
This will start the web application, as well as the backend server.

## Testing Notes
When testing the edit function, the edit is saved once the user clicks out of the text field.
